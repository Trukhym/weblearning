<!--Info
Rebecca Quin (born 30 January 1987) is an Irish professional wrestler. She is currently signed to WWE under the ring name Becky Lynch, where she performs on the SmackDown brand.

Quin began training as a professional wrestler in June 2002. Initially working in Ireland and occasionally teaming with her brother using the ring name Rebecca Knox, she soon expanded her career into the rest of Europe and North America on the independent circuit, wrestling regularly for various promotions. She most notably competed in Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling and became the first wrestler to win the SuperGirls Championship in June 2005.

In September 2006, Quin suffered a severe head injury during a match in Germany which kept her away from professional wrestling for several years. She returned in late 2012 and signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2013, reporting to the developmental territory NXT. Following her arrival on WWE's main roster in July 2015, she became the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion at Backlash 2016 and since held the title twice as of December 2018. In January 2019, she won the 2019 women's Royal Rumble match. -->
